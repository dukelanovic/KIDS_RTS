# Security Policy

The best security policy is to make that whole damned thing open source (to have a better damnation 
among evil developers and producers) So, I am plannig not at all to invent any security on this software.
Me as a doomed developer - also was programming that game for many nights for the kids didn't gave a sh##
about all my efforts and for better playing Roblox... (Woodworking would be so much better...)
